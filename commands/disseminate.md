# Task 4: Dissemination

The user manual PDF has been generated. Please now handle version control and distribution.

## Version Control

You can assume that all documentation may be committed to the repository and pushed.

1. Stage all files in the `docs/` directory.
2. Commit with a descriptive message (e.g., "Add user manual v1.0 documentation").
3. Push to the remote repository.

## Distribution (Optional)

I may want to use an MCP to store the readable version of the documentation in PDF format elsewhere. If requested, please:

1. Use the appropriate MCP (e.g., file storage, cloud storage, or document management service) to upload the PDF.
2. Provide the link or location where the PDF has been stored.

### Potential Distribution Targets

- Cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Document management systems
- Notion or other knowledge bases
- Email distribution via Resend MCP

Once version control is complete and any requested distribution has been performed, confirm completion and provide a summary of actions taken.
