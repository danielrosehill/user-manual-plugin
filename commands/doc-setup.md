# Task 1: Documentation Repository Setup

I would like to create a user manual to document what we created today and ensure I remember how to operate this codebase in the future.

## Context

Please note that the intended use of this user manual is strictly for my own private reference. This is not intended as public documentation.

In the unlikely event that this repository also contains a public-facing document, please create these private documents in a separate path that is `.gitignore`d.

In most cases, however, there will not be any public-facing documentation created within a private repository.

## Setup Instructions

To begin creating the user manual, please proceed as follows:

1. Create a `docs` folder within this repository.
2. Within the `docs` folder, create the following subdirectories:
   - `sections/` - for individual documentation sections
   - `assets/` - for diagrams and other assets
   - `output/` - for the final compiled documentation
3. If there are previous iterations of user manual documentation visible, note the highest version number for use in subsequent tasks.

Once the folder structure is in place, confirm completion and await the next task instruction.
